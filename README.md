Overview:
This project was developed as part of the Databases and Web Services course at Constructor University.
Cocktail'Database is an interactive web application where users can browse, search, and manage cocktail recipes. 
It combines database management, user authentication, and dynamic content delivery, with a strong focus on user experience, front-end styling, and data integrity. 
The project allowed us to apply and integrate frontend and backend development skills using HTML, CSS, PHP, and Java.

Features:
The application opens with a homepage where users can explore a curated selection of cocktail recipes. It includes a search bar for locating specific cocktails 
and advanced filtering options based on ingredients, alcohol content, origin, and flavor profile. Users may also discover a "Cocktail of the Day" feature. 
If a search yields no matches, the system displays a friendly "no results found" message, ensuring a seamless user experience.

User account management is an integral part of the platform. Visitors can register an account, log in, and log out securely. 
Once logged in, users have the ability to save their favorite recipes and manage personal collections. Input validation is implemented throughout the platform; 
for instance, users attempting to register with incorrectly formatted email addresses receive appropriate error messages.

Beyond basic browsing, users can interact with recipes by liking them, marking them as favorites, and rating them on a five-star scale. 
Logged-in users are also encouraged to leave comments and reviews on recipes. To maintain quality and appropriateness, 
the platform moderates inappropriate content and restricts invalid ratings (such as values outside the permitted range).

Each user has a personalized profile page where they can view and edit their saved recipes and favorite collections. 
Users' ages are displayed within their profiles, which allows the system to prevent underage users from accessing alcoholic cocktail recipes. 
Profile updates are validated and securely saved to the database, maintaining both data consistency and user security.
